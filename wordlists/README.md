## üõ†Ô∏è Usage Examples

### Subdomain Enumeration
```bash
# Using gobuster
gobuster dns -d target.com -w wordlists/subdomains_comprehensive.txt

# Using ffuf
ffuf -w wordlists/subdomains_comprehensive.txt -u https://FUZZ.target.com

# Using amass
amass enum -brute -w wordlists/subdomains_comprehensive.txt -d target.com
```

### Directory Brute Forcing
```bash
# Using gobuster
gobuster dir -u https://target.com -w wordlists/directories_comprehensive.txt

# Using ffuf
ffuf -w wordlists/directories_comprehensive.txt -u https://target.com/FUZZ

# Using dirb
dirb https://target.com wordlists/directories_comprehensive.txt
```

### API Endpoint Discovery
```bash
# Using ffuf for API discovery
ffuf -w wordlists/api_endpoints.txt -u https://target.com/api/FUZZ

# Using gobuster for API enumeration
gobuster dir -u https://target.com/api -w wordlists/api_endpoints.txt
```

### Sensitive File Discovery
```bash
# Using ffuf
ffuf -w wordlists/sensitive_files.txt -u https://target.com/FUZZ

# Using gobuster
gobuster dir -u https://target.com -w wordlists/sensitive_files.txt -x php,txt,conf,bak
```

### Technology-Specific Testing
```bash
# WordPress enumeration
ffuf -w wordlists/technology_specific.txt -u https://target.com/FUZZ -mc 200,403,301,302

# Framework detection
gobuster dir -u https://target.com -w wordlists/technology_specific.txt -s 200,204,301,302,403
```

## üéØ Optimization Tips

### 1. **Combine Wordlists**
```bash
# Merge multiple wordlists for comprehensive coverage
cat wordlists/directories_comprehensive.txt wordlists/sensitive_files.txt > combined_dirs.txt
```

### 2. **Filter by Response Codes**
```bash
# Focus on interesting status codes
ffuf -w wordlists/directories_comprehensive.txt -u https://target.com/FUZZ -mc 200,401,403,301,302
```

### 3. **Add File Extensions**
```bash
# Test with common extensions
gobuster dir -u https://target.com -w wordlists/directories_comprehensive.txt -x php,html,asp,aspx,jsp,txt,conf,bak
```

### 4. **Rate Limiting**
```bash
# Avoid overwhelming the target
ffuf -w wordlists/directories_comprehensive.txt -u https://target.com/FUZZ -rate 10
```
